This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in HTML and JavaScript. The bug occurs when attempting to access the `textContent` property of a div element after its `innerHTML` has been set to an empty string and its `display` style is set to `none`.  This can lead to inconsistent behavior across different browsers. The solution shows how to properly handle this situation by checking the element's state before attempting to access its `textContent`.
